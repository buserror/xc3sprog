This program should run without installation as root.

$ make


A simple example is included that copies the switches to the LEDs on the
Xilinx Spartan3 Starter Kit.

$ ./xc3sprog -c pp echo_out.bit


The Platform Flash PROM of the Xilinx Spartan3 Starter Kit can be programmed
by specifying it's location in the JTAG chain. Example command line below.

$ ./xc3sprog -c pp echo_out.bit 1


There is also a utility program included that parses and prints the header
of a Xilinx .bit file.

$ ./bitparse echo_out.bit

The jtagProgram.sh use zenity (from gnome-utils-X.X.X.rpm) and sudo (from
sudo-X.X.X.rpm) and assume xc3sprog installed in
	/usr/local/jtag/XC3Sprog

To configure sudo edit as root the file /etc/sudoers  whith the command
visudo and add the follow:

ALL  ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/mknod /dev/parport0 c 99 0, /usr/local/jtag/XC3Sprog/detectchain, /usr/local/jtag/XC3Sprog/xc3sprog * *
