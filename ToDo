- Use Bitarrays and not One-Byte-for-a-Bit in javr
- AT90CAN reads back the flash as Bytes. With USB transfers, 
  this is damned slow. Provides some mechanism to queue read requests
- Compress the XC3AN bit files and include into the binary
- More cables
- Cleanup C++ code
- More devices (XC2C, XC95xx (without X))
- Other devices with published 1532 algorithm
- Bitorder for Intel HEX format
- Finer granularity for erasing XCFP
- ... 
- Check Byte Oder IHEX versus MCS
- Document cable Database
