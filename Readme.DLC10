090605: 
Tested with a DLC10 cable.

The buffer size could be increased substantial against Koljas observations
on the DLC9, resulting in great speed increase. 

Time to programm the 1 MByte "bscan_spi/sp3adsp-fg676.bit" file to a
XC3SD1800A is about 6 seconds, versus 3 seconds in Impact. Probably impact
selects a higher TCK speed. Didn't look for the appropriate message in
deepth.

Internal chain didn't work for the DLC9, neither in SVN-urjtag, nor in
xc3sprog.
