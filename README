This program should run without installation. For accessing USB cables, libusb0
is required as runtime dynamic linked libray.

To compile, you need CMAKE, the static libftdi library and usb.h. 

$ mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make

To crosscompile for Win32 with mingw:

$ mkdir build-win32; cd build-win32; 
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain-mingw32.cmake ..

Get a description with 

$ ./xc3sprog -h

Get a chain description:

$ ./xcs3prog -j

Device descrption is searched in the file pointed to by the XCDB environment 
variable, or when not found the built-in list is used

Test the chain integrity

$ ./xc3sprog -T -j

Here "-j" stops xc3sprog from entering the program/verify/read the part. If
things go wrong, an endless loop is entered to facilitate hardware degugging
with the scope.
Stop with ^C.

The Platform Flash PROM of the Xilinx Spartan3 Starter Kit can be programmed
by specifying it's location in the JTAG chain. Example command line below.

$ ./xc3sprog -c pp -p 1 <bitfile.bit>

Program the flash of an XC3S50AN by loading the bscan_spi bitfile
first. Aassume the XC3S50AN as single part in the jtag chain

$ ./xc3sprog  ../bscan_spi/xc3s50an.bit

Now program the flash

$ ./xc3sprog -I <your_bitfile.bit>

Verify the flash content against a file

$ ./xc3sprog -I -C <your_bitfile.bit>

You can readout XCF/ISF flash and CPLD

$ ./xc3sprog -r (-I) <file to store>

xc3sprog handles XC3, XCF0x and XC95xxxXx. XC4 should work but is untested.

There is also a utility program included that parses and prints the header
of a Xilinx .bit file.

$ ./bitparse echo_out.bit

Jedecfiles for CPLD programming can be parsed with

$ ./jedecparse <jedecfile.jed>

When using a FT2232 programmer, speed is noticebly enhance with a USB-2.0 
Hub between the adapter and the PC. Some effort has been made to concatenate 
as many JTAG actions as possible.
